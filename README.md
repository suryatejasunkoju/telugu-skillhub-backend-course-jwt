This is a Spring Boot application that provides comprehensive security features by implementing JWT authentication and authorization uses the Spring Security module.
JWT is a stateless and self-contained token that can be used for authentication. It contains encoded information about the user and is digitally signed.
The application generates a JWT token upon successful user login or authentication, containing user-specific details and a secret key known only to the server.
The token is sent to the client and stored, typically in the browser's local storage or as a cookie.
For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT token in the Authorization header to authenticate itself with the server.
The server validates the token's signature using the secret key and verifies its integrity and expiration time.
Upon successful validation, the server grants access to the requested resources, implementing the authorization logic based on the user's roles or permissions stored within the token.
If the token is invalid or has expired, the server responds with an appropriate error message, denying access to protected resources.
The application may include endpoints to handle user registration, login, and logout, where passwords are typically securely hashed and stored in a database.
With Spring Boot's built-in support for JWT, developers can easily configure and customize the authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing for secure and controlled access to application resources.
